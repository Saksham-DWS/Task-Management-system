New Goal Context a feature addtion in the system which will be work and in sync with UI frontend with backend and Backend
DB



1. New Feature i wanted to add is AI Insights generation at Project level and at the admin insight panel level

-At Project level each Project at each project + its tasks insights will be Generated 
-And At Admin panel of Insights level full categories > Projects > and there related task level insights will be generated

I have A Open API key at my backend .env file, set a RAG pipeline with system prompt to AI in backend and it is sync with forntend UI and DataBase, 
where 

for example : 

****1
1st how the Project level AI insights will work  :  At for project the AI should gather the data from project and
its tasks ,  and also from it goal & Achievements Panel where
what AI Do is read the goal loggings and their achievement replies and compare the goal and achievements according to 
their replies and if the goal logg and after 7 day reply matches the goal AI generate a good health report 
under a topic od goals & Achievements at project level,

Also at task level there will be multiple tasks under a project at various stages so also AI know the project level data and all tasks 
data to generate the insights , also at task level ai also took data of goals and achievements from each tasks , and also analyse and contribute to
the project level insights

the Parameters the AI Generate the insights at Project AI Recomdation/Insights Panel is 

Under Project Level AI Insights Generations  : 

AI Citation, AI Recomendation 
1st At Project level Project Goal Achievements AI understant the date and Goal & Achievements Logs, 
2nd At Project tasks level AI got all project level all tasks data and their Goals & Achievements Logs, their current stage,
their due date , and all data of project from project level.

It will Generate AI Insights and Recomendation at Project level Insights Panel in approx 150-200 Words,

example : AI Insights/Recommendation
   
   1st it will generate a overall Project level insights with recommendation and overall health and priorities and on etc parameters,

   2nd in under it, it will generate each task level insights with health and recommendations

   like : task 1 : ............................................
        task 2 : .............................................
        task 3 : .............................................
        task 4 : .............................................
        task 5 : .............................................

Like this the AI recommendation system will work at Project Level in insights Panel at Project level
and also Give a UI Button "Generate" so all data of project level went to AI and AI response and Dump the 
Insights with best UI and DataBase , Backend and AI pipeline syncing so all project level insights will be shown whenver
the Generate insights will be click generally it is a API request for manually generating the insight with fresh data went to AI 
and insights will be dumpped in the manner i stated above.

Also there be a system logic so system on each 2 days System initiate a request to the AI with fresh and current data to generate Insights at Project levels,

There are n number of project and the system should have n number of data , so maybe Ai could be overlaod so
kindly manage the Insights generation of each project with best solutions so AI could not be overwhelmed and make api call 
accordingly when creation of project after 2 days or each 2 days after , so each project Auto insights generations will not be overloaded and cross and overwhelmed.

Insights Generation at Admin panel Insights panel level 

We will generate AI analysis and AI insights and Recommendation at Insights Panel at Admin panel level in left side bar component.

At Insights level Our AI Got ALL data of the system like current date weather of all categories, projects and their tasks and users as well

AI will generate tasks on basis categories health, categories performance,
project health, project performance, with also getting each projects tasks level data too, 

At AI analysis : 
-Generates AI analysis about project , tasks, categories and user work done insights taking data form project goals & achivement amd comments too,

AT AI Recommendations : 
-generate AI recommendation and health report : 
-On Parameters of categories, projects and each projects tasks level
-Focus Area: 
-Team Balance:
Quick Win:

with each categories  : project  : 30 words AI insight info 
                       and each project 20 word insight 

Like generating atleast 1000-1500 words AI Recommendation at Admin Insights Panel level
By getting fresh data on every 3 days as our system make API call in every 3 days 
with AI Information dumping with good UI and text and recommendation Formating.
with backend and DB and AI pipeline syncing.

Also we will give a Ui button on Admin Insights panel on AI Analyis and AI Recomdation component with a refresh 
button so it will be a manual trigger to make a API call to generate AI insights with current data of the application taking the date of 
Categories, Projects, And Projects tasks and user performances etc then generate rhe AI Analyis & AI recommendation At the moment.
