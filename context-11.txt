**New Goal Context a feature addtion in the system which will be work and in sync with best Tailwind React UI frontend with backend and Backend Database syncing***


1. I wanted to add a new feature in the application which is goal and achivement panel, which is different from project and group level ,
goal and achievement panel is a module in its own self,

It is shown to every user a goal & achivement panel,

In goal and achievement Panel user can assign a Goal to a user and user will be a assignee 

each user have My Goals and Assigned by me panel in goal and achievement panel :

Here are functions and potential UI and actions info :

✅ Key UX Principles (From Your Sketch)

✔ Clean separation of Pending vs Achieved
✔ Strong emphasis on Monthly tracking
✔ Comments reflect directly on Goal Cards
✔ Horizontal scrolling for history & charts
✔ Clear assigner vs user actions
assigner user can delete the assigned goal that he created for other user and that goal will be deleted from the assignee my goal panel and will not be in record.


In app notification & Email notification:  

1.when a assinger assign a goal to user(assignee) 

assigner got : You apply a goal to {user name},  by x date and time.
assingee got : assinger user name, applied a goal to you {goal name} , by x date and time.

same for email notification too for this action.

2. When a assignee mark approve the goal he got showing in his my goal panel:

assignee get :  You marked a goal {goal name} as achived.
assigner get : A goal {goal name} marked achived by the assingee name, that has been assigned by you.

same for email notification too for this action.

3. when assignee user add comment on the goal after completion :

assignee get :  You add a  comment "comment" on the goal name assigned by assigner user name. x date and time.
assigner get : User{user name} added a comment on the goal "goal name" you assigned to , "comment",  x date and time.

same for email notification too for this action.



4. when assinger add comment on the goal in which he assigned to a user:

assinger get: You added a comment {comment} on the {goal name} of the user name assigned by you., x date and time.
assigne get : A comment {comment} has been added on the goal {goal name} by the assigner {assigner name}, x date and time.

same for email notification too for this action.






2. In the UI of goals card the card showing should be same and the mark achived button alignment should be 
same even if the description is shared

if description is shared to precure the text geeting outside of the card,
the description should show like this "little bit description" ending with .....more.
and when user click more it will drop and open full description,

3. Make the UI of goal card component scrollable after 4 goals showing when 4 goals 
show 4 cards , when goals will more than 4 show the scrollable card component where we can 
see all goals by scroll down
