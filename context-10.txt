1. Hey I wanted to add a new user which is "manager" 

A manager user is just like normal user but with extended capabilities, we will show the manager
AI Insights panel, Project & Group panel by default but there is a catch manager can only see project or groups who have 
access to it like admin give the group or project access to the manager,

Manager can create Group and project and can only delete the group or project that he created , 
but the groups or projects access given to him he cannot delete it via settings, but he can give access to other user's in the project or group level accordingly
if the project & group access given to him

In AI Insights panel :  Manager can only see the Insights of Project groups users that he assigned or he is present or created

when manager account maded by default the Groups and project panel were empty and having create group button in group,

and admin and super admin can only create the manager show the manager access option when creating a user

Also in my work Manager can see all tasks that he is involved in as usual
