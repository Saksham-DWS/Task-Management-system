**New Goal Context a feature addtion in the system which will be work and in sync with best Tailwind React UI frontend with backend and Backend Database syncing***


1. Hey I want to add new feature in my application via using a nodemailer and a Email & internal notification
system where my backend frontend UI and Database should be in full sync

I want that my system generates Internal notifications to the user on there notification panels as well as 
email notifications to their registered email id's.

1st the Internal notification , notification panel

when notification comes the red dot shows on the bell icon 
and when user click on the bell icon ,
a notification page opens a internal notification page where user can see all notifications
an can mark those notifications , Raed, Unread, or also can delete.

something like  : 

ALL          Marked Read       Marked unread 


when notification comes it shows in all

"A Task has been assinged to you by user x , x date & time,   tick to mark read cross to mark unread and a delete button infront of the notification.

if user tick and mark read that notification went to mark read panel ,
and if user click on 'Marked read'.
a new component opens and he can see all notification Under marked read panel of that category 

similarly for unread if user click x cross in all notification in front of a notification that notification went to unread panel.


2nd for email notifications 

In same actions email notifications and internal notifications will be generated to the respected user 
on basis of the scinario triggers

we will use email notification via nodemailer i will put .env vars for nodemailer like smpt address, or what ever required in the backend 
.env , so one thing also write example variables in .env file of backend who are required for these tasks to happen

2.1. Scinarios notification will be went to the respected users or multiple users

Gnerate notification when  : 
1.User Got the task or task assinged by some user to x user's {Both Email and Internal notification with the relevent details in the notification and email}
2.notification generated when a Task You are involved in completed or completed by you other connected user's will get the email and internal notification
3.Generates Email and internal notification when someone comments on your tasks.
4.Generates email and internal notification when someone comments on you project comments if you are project owner
5.A weekly Digest  : where you will get weekly email of summary of last week work. [ Via AI powered weekly digest sync between Backend and AI pipeline]



***3

Also the Optation of the what email / internal notification you should be receiving 
in teams and access your admin can define what sort of emails /internal notification you will be getting based on the trigger 
on you account level from you Admin 

The notification optoutaion feature has to be working.,



Understand My intent ,vision and thinking , what type of notification system i am wanting 
with full sync of the user actions like categories access giving, project access giving, categories creation, project creation,
task creation, task completion etc ,
with error free code and with best code quality and in sync with Best Tailwind React Frontend UI & Backend with AI power and Database sync.

Take step wise approach with logical, Practical, Adaptive approach



*******AI recommendations for notifications *********:



Short answer: with SMTP configured and SMTP_ENABLED=true, users will get both in‑app and email notifications for the events we wired, as long as their notification preferences allow it.

What is currently covered:

Task assigned (on create or when assignees are added)
Task completed (status moved to completed; notifies all participants except the actor)
Task comments (notifies task participants except the actor)
Project comments (notifies the project owner, except the actor)
Weekly digest (only if the user’s weekly_digest preference is enabled)
Important behavior notes:

In‑app notifications are stored in DB and shown in the bell + /notifications page.
There is no real‑time push; the header polls every 60s and the notifications page loads on visit.
If a user disables in_app or email in preferences, that channel won’t send.
Not yet wired (if you want them):

Category/project access changes, category/project creation, etc. These aren’t emitting notifications right now.
If you want, I can:

Add missing triggers (access changes, category/project creation, etc.).
Add real‑time updates via WebSocket or SSE.
Add admin‑side audit logs + notification templates.



************* Performance Optimization **************

Hey You have full code base access , 

I want to increase the in app actions syncablility , for example when a user creates a task it took 3-4 sec to load and show yes the task has been assigned , or if admin move the task from Not started to in-progress or any other forward stage , the application took moment to show the action syncing , for example this happend the moment , i drag from Not selected to inprogress , and at 1 sec spam i click on activity log of project level no log has been shown to that of a action and whn i refresh the browser manually then i see the logg of that action , which very unaccptable, it should load the moment i done any action , in the moment application should take 1 sec but it should show the actions logging or actions effect i the minutes of seconds like in 1.1s second i want the my application all actions syncablility to be fast so when my application is used by people at in scale like for example if 1000+ employees or a company user who are 1000+ and are using the application at the same time , my application should have to be fast enough that they did'nt think what project they bought it is disguting very slow, so thats why i want my application very actions reaction should takes place in 1's of second like in flintch , kindly do the need optimizations in my full code base so that , when i do any action for example  :  i moved a project as a project owner or admin from 'Not Started' stage to 'On Hold' or any stage forward the moment i done the action , and the moment i check actvity log i should see the action logging , and at the same time the user got the task a see the status has been changed also also see internal notfication for this stage moving action via admin/project owner at the moment , like this example in full application i want full syncing works in 1-2 seconds best performance and syncing optimization I want
