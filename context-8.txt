7. Another feature I wanted to add is adding the reason logging which will be saved in the comment as the comment 
at the task level comment.

So the moto is there are 2 cases :

case 1 :  when the task has been moved to "On Hold" by user or by the task assigned by user who assigned the task to user 

if assigned by user is on Kanban board at Project and he drag and drop any project from "In Progess" to "On Hold" or from "Pre-Task" to "On Hold" , 

he will se a pop up window/component where he need to log the reason to Hold this task , and if he log the reason and click accept the reason will be 
logged in as a comment at the task level comment to that task who has marked to "On Hold" ,  this action also saves in the activity log of the project level with task name and also in that certain task level actvity logging.

also if assigned by user open the particular task and mark the task to "On Hold" from the task level
will still see the reason logging window/component in center of screen for logging the reason to on-hold that task,
and the reason log to the comment section in task level commenting as a comment.

and for user the process is same if user only have task access , he only can mark the status to "On-Hold" 
so he also need to log the reason of task to "On Hold", so when user mark the task as "On Hold" from the status
selecting drop down ,  and the moment he click on "On Hold" , The reason logging window/component open in middle of the screen
so user can logg the reason and click accept so the reason will be logged and the status will be marked "On Hold" 
we give the close "x" button to the component and close button to so if the user/project level assigned by mistake drag to On Hold or 
mark the task on hold the they can cancel that actions 

On Hold : status will only be marked when the user logg the reason and the reason will be saved to comment at task level commenting and also the activity log also logg the action as well, also the project level activity log also log the action of task been moved to On Hold.

UI  : 
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

|  |                                                              |      |
|  |                                                              |      |
|  |                                                              |      |
|  |                                                              |      |

|  |                                                              |      |
|  +--------------------------------------------------------------+      |
|                                                                        |
|                                                                        |
|                                                  | Close |   |Accept|  |

Case 2 : When task assingee user who got the task to mark the task as "Review"  which means submit for review to the 
assinged by user , and went to Kanban board in "review" section at project level,

and the assinged by user got the internal notification that a task from the user task name ,  has been marked to review by the 
task assignee user "who got the task" ,  so assigned by user see the notification and went to the project level 
and sees the task has been moved to "review" stage by the assinged to user "assignee" so he open that task and he 
sees the buttons to "Accept the submission " or "Decline" the task submission to "review" and moved to In-Progress again

here the new part i need to introduce is the loggig of the reason for the task to "decline" , 
when assingned by user click on the decline button to decline the task submission to "review",

the assingned by user need to log the reason to decline the task submission which has been marked "review"  by the task assignee user,
by this the reason has been log to the comment in the task level and noted also in task level activity log also user got the internal notification that this reason your task submission has been declined
and your task moved to the "In Progess" , and if the task assingned by user click on accept nothing happen the previous flow will be 
followed and the task moved to "Completed"  and user got the internal notification and email notification that your task has been accepted by the assingned by user name , to completed and your task has been 
completed.

understand what i am saying.

UI  : 
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Log the reason to Decline this Task                              x    |
|                                                                        | 
|  Reason                                                                |
|  +--------------------------------------------------------------+      |
|  |                                                              |      |
|  |                                                              |      |
|  |                                                              |      |
|  |                                                              |      |
|  |                                                              |      |
|  |                                                              |      |
|  |                                                              |      |
|  +--------------------------------------------------------------+      |
|                                                                        |
|                                                                        |
|                                                  | Close |   |Accept|  |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

and the same when assinged by user log the reason of task decline and click accept the reason will be logged in the 
task level comment , and the task has been decline and moved back to 'In Progess' and the task level activity log the actions , also project level actvity log also log the action as like before,

Task level actvity log and project level activity log log the each and every action accordingly.



2. Hey i have thought i wanted to make the "review" text in the task level drop down 
to seen by user is name "Complete" but the logic is still same of "review" in real the 
status is "review" but in real the status drop down name will be "Review" but the text showing to 
user is "Complete", in the full project 

3. Hey i have thought i wanted to make a "Super Admin" and the functionality of super admin is same as admin
but there will be an exception , super admin can see all tasks data within the its My Work Panel
whatevere tasks are present in the system all tasks, 
 
and when super admin try to make a new user id he is the only one can see super admin drop down in account creation
so super admin can create Another super admin but normal admin cannot create a super admin id ,

the intial super admin we will make is : admin@dws.com  email id, 

and this mail id will be super admin and super admin can see all tasks in the MY Task panel who are present with in the system
 the system which are currently going on , presnt, future, and past tasks of all users tasks under its my work panel.


4. Super Admin user can also see insights panel and team & access panel in his account dashboard
currently it is only availabel to admins only
