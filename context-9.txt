Understand what i am thinking and my vision and show according to user's admin and super admin access logic of the system


3. Hey i have a question for you if a email id and its named account was deleted and after some days 
the account will be created with same email and and name , so our system understand and know this user is the 
same user and that will again see its named created tasks, projects, groups like all data and accessed projects and groups
like he will again see all data of him ? 

Ans  :  No — deleting a user removes that user document and creates a new user ID on re‑register, even with the same email/name. The system does not link the new account to old data.

Why:

Ownership/access links use user IDs (not email), so tasks/projects/groups keep the old assigned_by_id, owner_id, and access lists.
Deleting a user does not reassign or migrate those references.
Code paths:

User deletion: users.py
Task/project access is ID‑based: tasks.py, projects.py
Result:

The recreated account will not automatically see old tasks/projects/groups unless you manually add the new user ID to access lists or transfer ownership.
