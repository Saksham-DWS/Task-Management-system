**New Goal Context a feature addtion in the system which will be work and in sync with best Tailwind React UI frontend with backend and Backend Database syncing***


1. In our project to close our projects when all tasks under that project reached the completed stage that project will be marked as closed in Internal backend , On frontend UI, and with in DataBase
until and unless no new task is created/ generated in that project.


2. Insight Panel UI , Backend Logic and AI pipeline of Insights updating.

Admin Panel AI Insights Update where admin can view all Users, Groups, and their Projects AI Insights 
via applying filters
first remove the current AI recommendations panel in left of AI Insights.

Understand my approach what i am think 

**1st On opening top of AI insight Panel in admin dashboard we will show all backend + DataBase + UI synced 
KPI boxes
1.Total Numbers of Groups
2. Total Projects 
3. On Going
4. Overdue [How much projects over from there due date]

& Remove the current kpi type boxes Remove , at risk on track and need attention.

**Note  :  if no filters and anything applied the KPI i mentioned will show full global system data according to their roles.


**2nd : Now filter wise Insights in best format**

If no filter was choosen by the admin on AI Insights panel AI generates Overall AI insights of top 5 recent projects and related groups and related tasks
in a best comprehensive and best formatting way : like with Pointers, Topics, and heading and explaintion

in these particiantions : insights : 

                          Overview : 

                          Conclusions :
   (like work done, how good work the users are doing, foucus areas, any delay or not, recommendations according to AI of those top recent projects )

   And in Overview AI should also shows who's top 5 Projects Insigths are its is giving : who are in-progress and recently maded and who have more users in it.
   based on Project level goals and achievements and +7 day of achievement comparison with goal, and commenting , also task level goals and achievements comparision bases and commenting on various task 
   task , projects , health, health score and analysis
   levels.



**Now comes the filters part on basis of which the AI insights will be generated :

**we will apply combinational filter and based on the filter the below modules
AI insights results will come in Insight Panel for example :   AI Analyis, Project Health and details, Group Performance, 
group insights, project insights.

***Below KPI there will be filters

1.Group Filter          |            Projects filter            |        Users filter


All filters are connected with each other and dependent on each others.

**Groups : groups filter : can select groups from all groups
          selected : group 1 x, group 2 x, x croos for remove 
          and also a searchable and scrollbale bar from pool of all groups
          just like access giving in our system,

          G1 x,  G2 x
      |Search ALL Groups|

**Projects and Users are also same.

Now here comes the logical part:

***All filters are dependent on each other based on hierarchy

***1 : if user choose any group and when there be delay of 3-4 second the system auto pull all data from 
that group and AI got the data and generates AI insight and other modules data insights and data change happen.

***2 : So we already know our AI Insights generation feature will dependently pn each other.

for example  :  if user select Group 3 from group pool,
so when person reaches the next filter which is project only those project will shows on the project pool
who are comes under the previous choosed group , eg : group 3.
and its projects =[p1,p2,p3 ] are under group 3. so user could only see projects of group 3 if choosen
group 3 under groups filter.

and after a 3-4 sec delay Our AI system will generate insights :  based on the all data of choosed
filters  :  like for example  :  group 3 and project 2  :  insights only with all their deep insights like full users , tasks and other things comes under this combinational filters and data insights.

***C1 : A constraint is there an so it should be understandable and change automatically
if user not choosed the group filter and only know project name and so it try to filter with projects,
so our system understands which the choosen project from of which group so our system directly understands , auto shows the Group name under the group filter even if group is not selected by user.
and again generates AI insights just like before with a 3-4 sec delay. and show whole insights with correct data of selected groups and project.

***C2 : A constraint is there an so it should be understandable and change automatically
if user not choosed the Group or Projects directly from there filter outs and directly went to users filter 
and there will full pool of all users showing so admin user select any random user so
so based on that selected user - previous filters will auto change and show all groups and projects 
that the choosen user is involved in or have tasks in projects 
and after the 3-4 sec delay our AI insights will be generated with that choosen user data., and only that user AI insights 
of its all projects, tasks , commnting, goals & achievement of project level if he is a project owner,  and task level commenting and goals and achievements.
All AI Insights modules will show the Insights accordingly on based on the selected user data. 

for example  : 

Admin or accessed User directly choose user from the drop or search in user filter In Ai Insight Panel
 
 +------------------------+       +--------------------------------+        +--------------------------------+
 | Groups : G1 x, G2 x .  |       | Projects : P1 x, P2 x, P3 X .  |        | Users : Saksham x,             |
 +------------------------+       +--------------------------------+        +--------------------------------+

 Based on the selected user all data where he is involved all access details updated and accordance of the user 
 all project or groups he is involved is came 

And our smart system only sends all data related to the AI in AI pipeline so AI could generate the best AI Insight Possible

System understands this that this choosen user insight it need to generate ,  so after 3-4 delay system auto gather the filtered
users data or Only projects or only group.

and send to AI for analysis : Then AI return best looking textual Ai Analyis with Bullets points , project headings, tasks headings Highlighted, topics, goal & achievement summary both at project and at task level at project compares to previous week goal and the achievement entry is matching or not as well 
takable, with best formatting, no clutterness.

and based on that other modules of AI insights will also show the results and accurate data 

Projects Health      |      Group Performance

Group Insights       |      Project insights


Understand the underlying logic and make a logic so that system only sends seleted users , or groups or project data for AI Insights generation,

case 1 :  Nothings is choosen in filter 3-4 delay system auto send top 5 recent projects data with users, access holders and tasks and group it is in data and it will generate 
AI Insights.

case 2 : If user choose Only a Group or multiple Groups from group filter our smart system understand that user only want group level to down level AI insights,
so after 3-4 sec delay after only groups filter choose system Understands, and send all data of both or choosen groups
to AI to generate AI insights with  :  forexample : Groups topic name then projects under those groups, people under those groups , task under those groups project have 
and all related data behalf insights will be shown.

case 3 : if user not select group and directly select the project or projects from the project filter system
system auto shows the groups or group of those choosen project or project in in groups filter and then after delay of 4-5 sec 
system give all data of those choosen projects only to the AI to generate meaning full Ai insights.

case 4 important ** : User based Ai Insight If Admin user wanted to se only a user insights but he dont know user project or group
so he directly reach to users filter search / choose the user name form drop down or search base reults, and select that user 
so our system understand the selectedd user or users projects they are involved in and those groups and project auto shows up in Group and project filter
then after 5-6 sec delay system gather all related data of those users or user from that of a system and send the all data related to user, if he has project so send project details,
project level commenting, priority, goals & achievement, and task level goals and achievements, and etc related data to AI so Ai could generate 
the insights comprehensively and accordingly too.


Note  :  those projects who are marked closed by the system so system should not send those projects data or tasks even if the user is selected from the user filter and 
in that project or task user was the participant or closed marked projects will also not show under project filter even if search they will show blurred and not selectable
they will only be available in the system and un marked closed only when new task was created in them understand what i am saying.


case 5 :  ALL Filters will work in combination and dependend on each other , 
for example : a normal flow admin user selected , a Group form group filter, then he seleted the project or projects from project
filter drop down or searchable system one like access system ,  so in user filter drop down, or searchable pool only show those user names who are involved in the selected project or projects 
or common user who are in both or a project access person or a normal user then the System send the selected user data to Ai to generate Ai insights even if a user is of 
with project access or a normal user  :  if normal user he must only have task level and only all tasks under those selected projects all data will went to AI , and 
if user have project level access and also a tasks assignee in that of a project  :  so system send project level data , 
like Project goals & achievement & as well as commenting as well as task level commenting and goals and achievements.

example just for your understanding like  :  Group  : G1 X.       |  Projects : P1 x,  P2 x.      |     users : U1 from P1, P2. U2 from P1. U3 from P2. U4 from P1.

like that , also another case if user choose Group from group filter
so like  :  G2 x, so in projects and all projects come under G2 will shown and in user all users will be shown under G2 or if project is selected the 
filteration is more simple out and now shows only those users name in user filter who are comes under those selected project 

and in each filteration stage if selected or not seleted our system send till filter data to AI to generate AI insights in each 5-6 seconds by understanding user is done
filtering now send all filtered and related data to Ai to generate AI insights. And show on Ai insights panel and other modules of AI Insights

Understand my thinking my approach and update the UI , Backend logic and data gathering and sending via filters and make best filter logics 
and update and refine AI insights pipeline with best format , headings, topics and other recommendations and all in sentences and in bullet points
for best viewing experience.





3. we will take/copy the project details component module form the report and place it in place of project health in AI insight
panel a Module and making sure it will also go in sync with applied filters and if no filter applied show data on according to no filter logic 
also powered with AI pipeline. with backend UI and Database sync with AI pipeline. and Ai power sync like Ai insights and filteraitons syncs.



******Potential UI desings with context which will in sync with Backend and Frontend UI and DataBase.*****

Data Giving and Insights generations : 

Hey I told you that when Admin user chooses a single user , 
only shows the insights of that user who is choosed under user 
filter in insights panel and only show the insights of his tasks
 he is involved in like all tasks he is assigned too , with 
{task level goals & achievements, commenting and other parameters and activity logs too}, 
or projects {commenting , goal & achivement, project overview , description , priority status, 
due date , overdue or not etc parameters} if have project level access , so only give user insights 
and its related data , and our system understand it and send the gathered data to Ai and AI will generate 
the insights all modules will be in sync 

Understand what i am saying because of this we will only see AI insights of work and other data of a selected user in user filter
no other users data will come thats how admin will know how much work a user is doing , where to do improvments, where user is lacking 
on which tasks user is doing good, on which tasks user not completed its tasks via (goals & achievements of tasks level by comparision of goal and achievement which click tick on the goal),
on which projects if user is have project level access how much good grip user have on its project ,
how much tasks assigned in the project or projects if multiple project access user have, 
project health (project priority stage, project due date exceeds or not what to do by AI), understand the 
achievement of project via goal and achievement of project level by comparision of goals and its after 7 day reply of achievement compare it 
that the work is really completed or not , project level commenting system.

By all these data user related AI insights and other insights modules will be updated and are in sync with the AI insight who got the all data of user form the system.
after filter applying.

Understand my intent and working of AI insights generation what i am visioning and how robust and
error free Ai insights i want in the AI insights panel.
with no AI hallucination and only give correct data insights 


I did'nt only mean show only those project that the user have access and groups but a comphrensive insights if he is access of any project as well have tasks in many project so insights of those tasks ,as well as show all projects and groups that he is involved in understand what i am saying previous one was good but the insights was not showing the comprehensive detailed insights , that i user selected how many project owner he is how much takss he is involved in and how many groups he is in and all each tasks and project level insights , understand
